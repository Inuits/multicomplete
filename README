Still in very early development. You can tackle or comment 
on any of the todos in the code. See the last line how to
use my KICKASS task manager.


Purpose:
  
  The purpose of this module is to enhance the current autocomplete 
  functionallity in drupal by an autocomplete that can fill in 
  multiple fields in one go. An example might be easier to understand:

  You have an input field with postal codes. The autocomplete contains
  the postalcode and also the associated city (or cities). Whenever
  you select the postalcode, we also fill in the city input field. Or
  we use it the other way arround: autocomplete on the city name and 
  fill out the postal code while we are autocompleting.


@todo: Add content and improve the lame text above.

TODOS: 
 Use: grep -R -H -n @[t]odo *
